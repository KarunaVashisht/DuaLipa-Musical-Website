         If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never, baby
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever, every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (whoo)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm levitating (whoo)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (whoo)
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my arse off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my arse off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
I got you (yeah), moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night (all night), come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (whoo)
You can fly away with me tonight (tonight)
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (take you for a ride)
I'm levitating (whoo)
You can fly away with me tonight (tonight)
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (let me take you for a ride)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (you are my starlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (come on, dance with me, baby)
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me

        If you don't wanna see me
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now

        You call me all friendly
Telling me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been moving on, since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creeping
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been moving on, since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna get to me
I see you begging on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tchh, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscing on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't coming back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)
I see you tryna get to me
I see you begging on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees

        One
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But, my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules; I count 'em
I got new rules; I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules; I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn) No way
(Nowhere to turn) No
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But, my love (love)
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself, I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules; I count 'em
I got new rules; I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules; I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I
(I got new, I got new, I...)
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin'
'Cause he's drunk and alone (yeah, alone)
Two: Don't let him in
You have to kick him out again (oh, ooh)
Three: Don't be his friend (again)
You know you're gonna wake up
In his bed in the mornin' (bed in the mornin')
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules; I count 'em
I got new rules; I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules; I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't

I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore

I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love, and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud

        I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm fallin'
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you fallin'?
Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
Now I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
I wonder when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
Now I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?

        Last night, my fantasies become oh-so true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then though baby, I'd be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do
Can I get it like that, that, that, let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that, let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
(Know, know, know)
In my dreams
You'd say you want me and my body
In my dreams
You'd say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You'd say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams
You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams
Inside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name
It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is ticking, we gotta leave now
Time is ticking, and we gotta leave town tonight
Can I get it like that, that, that, let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
(Know, know, know)
In my dreams
You'd say you want me and my body
In my dreams
You'd say you need me, believe me

You'd say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams

You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, you love me right

In my dreams, dreams, dreams, yeah

        Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
